## 🔍 Project Overview

This project tackles the challenge of **automated music genre classification** using machine learning. As streaming platforms grow, so does the need for intelligent systems that can organize vast music libraries. Accurate genre tagging enables better search, personalization, and user experience.

However, genres often blend acoustically — for instance, hip-hop and rap — making this a complex and technically interesting problem. Our goal is to compare and evaluate multiple classification models to find the most effective approach for automatic music tagging.

## 🎯 Goals

- Build and compare **three classification models**:
  - **Random Forest** – Handles non-linear relationships
  - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** – Effective in high-dimensional spaces
  - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** – Intuitive and good at pattern detection
- Use **audio features** as input data
- Tune hyperparameters using **cross-validation** to optimize each model
- Focus evaluation on **precision** to reduce incorrect genre assignments
- Identify the best-performing model with **scalability and interpretability** in mind

## 📚 Prior Research

This project draws inspiration from *Bahuleyan et al.*'s 2018 study, _“Music Genre Classification Using Machine Learning Techniques”_, where the authors experimented with models like **SVM, KNN, and CNN**. Their study showed that **KNN performed well** due to its ability to capture acoustic patterns — a finding we also explore and expand upon in our work.

## 📈 Model Evaluation Strategy

Each model is evaluated based on:
- **Precision** (primary metric)
- **Cross-validated performance**
- Interpretability and scalability for deployment
